# Wharf Jenkinsfiles

Our Jenkinsfile's and other pipelines that we have been using together with
Wharf.

The Dockerfile inside this repository creates a Docker image that hosts these
files as a read-only Git remote, so Jenkins can read from it.

> :warning: This repository is highly experimental right now. Use with care!
